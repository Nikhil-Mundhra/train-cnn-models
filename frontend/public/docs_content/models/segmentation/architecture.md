# Model Architecture: Hierarchical Multi-Task U-Net (MTL)

This document outlines the architecture for the core Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model used in this pipeline. The model is built using PyTorch and follows a modified U-Net design to accommodate both the hierarchical nature of retinal anatomy (segmentation) and hierarchical disease diagnosis (classification).

## 1. Overview

The `HierarchicalUNet` acts as a "Best of Both Worlds" network. It addresses two distinct but complementary challenges:
1. **Segmentation**: Extracting both broad structural anatomical regions (like the overall retina vs. background) and highly granular, specific pathologies (like subretinal fluid or specific cellular layers) using dual segmentation heads.
2. **Classification**: Providing a comprehensive 15-class diagnostic tree using a strict 3-layer hierarchical multi-label classification system.

By training on both tasks jointly, the shared encoder learns a universal feature representation that benefits both precise boundary localization and broad diagnostic pattern recognition.

---

## 2. Shared Backbone (Encoder-Decoder)

The model utilises a U-Net backbone with **Attention Gates** on every skip connection:

- **Encoder (Downsampling)**: 4 blocks. Each block applies two `3×3 Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU` operations, followed by a `2×2 MaxPool`. Channel progression: 1 → 64 → 128 → 256 → 512 → 1024.
- **Bottleneck**: The deepest layer (1024-channel) capturing the most compressed abstract representation of the scan.
- **Decoder (Upsampling)**: 4 blocks. Each block performs:
  1. `2×2 ConvTranspose2d` — upsamples the decoder feature map.
  2. **Attention Gate** — learns a spatial attention mask that filters the corresponding encoder skip connection *before* it is concatenated, suppressing irrelevant background activations.
  3. **Concatenation** of attended skip + upsampled feature.
  4. Two `3×3 Conv → BatchNorm → ReLU` operations.

The output of the final decoder block is a high-resolution 64-channel feature tensor at the original input resolution.

### Why Attention Gates?

OCT B-scans have retinal layers that are spatially continuous across the full width of the image (e.g., the ILM spans all 512 pixels horizontally). Pure local convolutions treat pixels at `x=0` and `x=511` independently, which is anatomically incorrect. Attention Gates learn *where* in the image each structural feature should appear, enabling spatially consistent boundary predictions. They add negligible compute overhead (~400k parameters across all 4 gates) while providing meaningful improvement on thin-layer and small-lesion segmentation.

**Attention Gate — Signal Flow:**

    multiply["⊗ Multiply\nbroadcast over channels"]
    out["x̂\nAttended Skip Connection\nF_l channels"]

    g --> Wg --> add
    x --> Wx --> add
    add --> relu --> psi --> sigmoid --> multiply
    x --> multiply
    multiply --> out
```

The gate is a *soft mask* — values near 1 mean "keep this feature", near 0 mean "suppress it". Because the gating signal `g` comes from deeper in the decoder (where global context is understood), the gate can suppress background regions in the skip connection even before the decoder sees them.

## 3. The Dual Heads

Instead of directly outputting 15 classes from the decoder features, the architecture branches at the final decoder output:

### 3.1 The Coarse Head

The 64-channel decoder output passes through a `DoubleConv(64→64)` refinement block and a final `1×1 Conv` to produce a **3-channel** logit tensor.

| Class | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Background | Everything outside the retina |
| 1 | Structural Retina | Retinal tissue layers (ILM → RPE) |
| 2 | Pathologies / Fluid | Lesions, drusen, fluid accumulations |

This head is supervised explicitly during training with dynamically-generated coarse masks, forcing the shared backbone to learn robust macroscopic features before the granular head attempts fine classification.

### 3.2 The Granular Head

The granular head receives a **concatenation of two inputs**:
1. The shared decoder features (64 channels).
2. The **softmax probabilities** from the coarse head (3 channels) — *not* raw logits.

This 67-channel tensor passes through a `DoubleConv(67→64)` block and a `1×1 Conv` to produce the final **15-channel** granular logit tensor.

> **Why softmax probabilities, not raw logits?**
> Raw logits have arbitrary, shifting magnitude throughout training — the granular head cannot reliably interpret them as a spatial prior. Softmax maps them to a stable `[0, 1]` probability distribution, giving the granular head a semantically interpretable signal at every training step. This directly improves training stability and the quality of the coarse-to-fine conditioning.

---

## 4. The Hierarchical Classification Heads

Branching off via **Multi-Scale Aggregation** from the x3 (256-channel), x4 (512-channel), and x5 (1024-channel) encoder stages (via global average pooling, concatenation, and a learned linear projection to 1024-d), the model features three independent classification heads. To prevent contradictory predictions (e.g., L1 predicting "Normal" but L2 predicting "Diabetic Complications"), the network enforces **Strict Hierarchical Classification Conditioning** via cascaded features.

### L1: Binary Triage (Normal vs Abnormal)
- **Role**: Safely screens out healthy patients.
- **Input**: 1024-channel bottleneck.
- **Output**: 1 Logit (Binary) → Sigmoid.

### L2: Disease Router (Pathology Families)
- **Role**: Categorizes abnormal scans into one of five broad disease families.
- **Input**: 1025-channel tensor (1024 bottleneck + **L1 probability**).
- **Output**: 5 Logits → Softmax.

### L3: Granular Biomarkers (Multi-Label Specialists)
- **Role**: Detects highly specific biomarkers for multi-morbidity. Consists of 5 independent multi-label specialist MLPs.
- **Input**: 1030-channel tensor (1024 bottleneck + L1 probability + **5 L2 probabilities**).
- **Output**: 11 total granular logits → Sigmoid.

## 6. Training Paradigm

See [`training_guide.md`](/docs/segmentation-training_guide) for the full training setup. At a high level, both tasks are trained simultaneously in an interleaved multi-task setup.

The unified loss function is:
`Total_Loss = Classification_Loss + (lambda_seg * Segmentation_Loss)`

Where `Segmentation_Loss` is a **Combined Dice + Focal Loss** on both segmentation heads:

```text
Segmentation_Loss = 0.5 × FocalLoss(weight=class_weights, gamma=2.0)
                  + 0.5 × DiceLoss()
```

To prevent the high-gradient segmentation task from destabilizing the classification feature space early on, `lambda_seg` begins at 0.01 (Warm-Up) and dynamically ramps up to 1.0 over the first 15 epochs. This joint supervision acts as a powerful regulariser, ensuring the model never loses the forest for the trees.

**Dynamic Segmentation Loss Warm-Up (`lambda_seg`):**

## 7. Industry Context

The following table places this architecture in the context of 2024–2025 OCT segmentation benchmarks:

| Architecture | Approx. Fluid Dice | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Vanilla U-Net | 0.70–0.80 | Baseline |
| **This model (Attention U-Net + Hierarchical Heads)** | **0.80–0.87 est.** | **Attention gates + coarse-to-fine conditioning** |
| nnU-Net (framework) | 0.85–0.92 | Auto-configured training pipeline |
| Swin-UNet variants | 0.87–0.93 | Transformer-based global context |

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "Approximate Fluid-Class Dice Score by Architecture (OCT Segmentation, 2025)"
    x-axis ["Vanilla U-Net", "This Model", "nnU-Net", "Swin-UNet"]
    y-axis "Dice Score" 0.0 --> 1.0
    bar [0.75, 0.835, 0.885, 0.90]
    line [0.75, 0.835, 0.885, 0.90]
```

The implemented architecture is solidly within the competitive range for a task of this complexity. The two primary gaps vs. SOTA are: (1) no topological consistency constraint to prevent layer crossing, and (2) no Transformer block at the bottleneck for long-range dependency modelling — both are reasonable targets for a future version.
